<p>The Stroker App is the software used to generate strokes which the Machine App can understand and direct the machine to paint. Alternatively the collection of generated strokes can be used by a human as a step-by-step set of instructions to creating the piece of art (see the gallery for examples of both approaches)</p>

<h3>What the App does</h3>
<hr>
<p>The function of the Stroker App is not to convert a digital image into a set of strokes using a predefined algorithm that takes in a bunch of settings.</p>
<p>The function of the Stroker App is to allow the user (human or machine) to create their own algorithms and then use these to convert a digital image into a collection of strokes. The idea is that over time the platform will become ever more flexible and allow users to create algorithms that capture their own artistic style.</p>
