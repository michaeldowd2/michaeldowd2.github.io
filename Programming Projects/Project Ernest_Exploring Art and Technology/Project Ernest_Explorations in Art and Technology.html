<p>Project Ernest is a project by Michael Dowd, it's all about exploring the boundaries between art and technology</p>
<hr>
<h3>Objectives</h3><ul>
<li>Develop a flexible software platform for defining a drawing/painting style that can be applied to a digital image and build a machine that can draw or paint the output from that software.</li>
<li>Use this platform to execute my own artistic ideas and produce powerful and original pieces of art.</li>
<li>Create an iterative agent based AI system with the ability to use the software to render previews of artistic works and provide score the works based on a dynamic artistic preference. The aim would be for the system to loosely simulate a community of artists and autonomously develop a preferred artistic style or styles over many iterations. It could then use the machine to create a actual pieces of art.</li>
</ul>
